# Arduino Uno and ESP8266 Serial Communication

This repository provides an example code for establishing serial communication between an Arduino Uno and an ESP8266 module. The Arduino Uno acts as the host, while the ESP8266 module serves as the client.
Prerequisites

# To run the code successfully, you'll need the following components:

    Arduino Uno board
    ESP8266 module
    USB cable for Arduino Uno
    Jumper wires

# Setup Instructions

    Connect the Arduino Uno and ESP8266 as follows:
        Connect the Arduino Uno's 5V pin to the ESP8266's VCC pin.
        Connect the Arduino Uno's GND pin to the ESP8266's GND pin.
        Connect the Arduino Uno's RX (pin 0) to the ESP8266's TX pin.
        Connect the Arduino Uno's TX (pin 1) to the ESP8266's RX pin.

    # Install the necessary libraries:
        Open the Arduino IDE.
        Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries.
        Search for "ESP8266" and install the "ESP8266WiFi" library.

    # Upload the Arduino code:
        Open the arduino_uno_serial.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
        Select the appropriate board and port under the Tools menu.
        Click the upload button to upload the code to the Arduino Uno.

    # Configure the ESP8266:
        Open the esp8266_serial.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
        Modify the SSID and password variables to match your Wi-Fi network credentials.
        Select the appropriate board and port under the Tools menu.
        Click the upload button to upload the code to the ESP8266 module.

   # Connect and power up the ESP8266:
        Disconnect the Arduino Uno from the computer.
        Connect the ESP8266 module to a power source (e.g., USB charger or power bank).

    #Test the communication:
        Reconnect the Arduino Uno to the computer.
        Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
        Set the baud rate to 115200.
        You should see the messages exchanged between the Arduino Uno and ESP8266.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following:

    Double-check the wiring connections between the Arduino Uno and ESP8266.
    Ensure that the correct board and port are selected in the Arduino IDE.
    Make sure that the ESP8266 is powered up and connected to the Wi-Fi network.
    Verify that the baud rate in the serial monitor matches the one specified in the code.
